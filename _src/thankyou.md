  <h3>What is Emerald MTB About</h3>
  <p>Emerald MTB is an online magazine covering all aspects of mountain biking in Ireland. It contains tales and reviews of mountain bike trails ridden, official and unofficial, and of bike parts, components and accessories that have been tried and tested. Every review is based purely on real life experience. The aim is to promote to the fledling scene of mountain biking in Ireland; what facilities &amp; services are available and what they offer; which parts do and do not work on the trails and in the conditions found in Ireland.</p>
  <p>Emerald MTB is represented on both coasts of Ireland with riders in Kerry, Limerick and Wicklow. Emerald MTB also supports the<a href="http://grassrootsenduro.com"> Grassroots Enduro Series</a>, the low-cost entry into the discipline of mountain bike Enduro racing organised by clubs across the south-west of Ireland, with social media, promotion and extended coverage of the series.</p>
  <p>In 2017 Emerald MTB added an online store to offer custom designed mountain bike jerseys. And with the aim of expanding the product range to include other useful bike related items. Planned for the very near future are maintenance and cleaning items that are not stocked in most mainstream bike shops.</p>
